Hang Glider Mod for Minetest
----------------------------
This is a fork of the minetest-hangglider mod by Piezo_ (orderofthefourthwall@gmail.com)

Which is located at:
    <https://notabug.org/Piezo_/minetest-hangglider>

**This version is an experimental version that is not intended for general use.**

This was synched up with Piezo_'s updates from Nov 25

- hud overlay and debug can be enabled/disabled
- Added blender-rendered overlay for struts using the actual model.
- Reduced airbreak penalty severity
- gave glider limited durability.

The only changes I've made are:

- Slightly blurred Piezo_'s excellent strut overlay.
- Created new blank.png with same size as Piezo_'s overlay.
- Piezo_ also increased flight speed to 1.75.  This was OK, but the transition seemed too abrupt.
    - I changed flight speed to also increase smoothly. It starts at 1 and maxes out at 1.75.
